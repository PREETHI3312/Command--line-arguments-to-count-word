To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Start the program.
### Step 2: 
 Create a text file in which words has to be counted.

import sys
count=0
with open(sys.argv[1],'r')as f1:
        for line in f1:
               word=line.split()
               count += len(word)
